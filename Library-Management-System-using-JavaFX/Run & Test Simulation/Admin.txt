How to Run and Test Admin Module

Navigating the Admin Module:
	Select the Admin radio button option to redirect to a sign in page, which prompts the user for a username and password.
	Valid admin login data can be found in the resources/admins.json file. 
	A successful login will redirect the user to a welcome admin page which displays three options that the user can select.
	
	Register Librarian:
		If the Register Librarian option is selected, the user will be prompted to fill a form with the librarian's information.
		All fields must have a valid value, otherwise an error message will display, with a prompt of valid inputs when the 
		register button is pressed. The email value must be unique; multiple librarians cannot share the same email.
		If the librarian is successfully registered, a success message will display. The user now has the option to go back or
		to register another librarian.
	
	Delete Librarian:
		If the Delete Librarian option is selected, the user will be prompted to fill a form with the librarian's employee id.
		This field cannot be empty, otherwise an error message will display when the delete button is pressed.
		If the entered employee id does not exist in the system, an error message will display. If the librarian is found in 
		the system, a success message will display that the librarian is deleted from the system. The user now has the option 
		to go back or to delete another librarian.
	
	View Librarians:
		If the View Librarians option is selected, the system will display a list of currently registered librarians in the 
		system with all their information except their passwords. A report of the currently registered librarians can be 
		found in the resources/registeredLibrariansReport.txt file. A go back button at the bottom of the screen allows the 
		user to return to the options menu for admin.
