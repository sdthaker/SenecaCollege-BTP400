Admin Class Assumptions

	There is no register admin functionality since admins are the highest level of this library system. 
	Admins are added manually to the admins.json file for this reason.

	A librarian can only be registered by using a unique email. 

	Reports are updated every time an admin views the list of librarians. Previous librarian list reports are not saved. The librarian report doesnt show the librarians password.
	 
	TextFields in any form cannot be left blank.
	
	Only one admin can be logged in at a time.
	
	There can be an unlimited number of librarians in the system.
	
	There can be no librarians in the system.
